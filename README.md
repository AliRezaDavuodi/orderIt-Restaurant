# About this App

this is a simple restaurant that you see popular foods when app is running, you also can search for specific food or desert etc.
you can add food to your cart, save food in your favorite food by like them and alos leave a comment for each food, but remember to do those you have to sign up otherwise your NOT allowed to do that.

in this project I use:

1. React Router v5
2. Redux to store data
3. firebase for authentication and save food's comments.
